1. Sprint Review


2. Sprint Planning
- ProcedureNode
- Fix user science.
AW on A/L then Mantid from 29/08 - 4 weeks, then A/L w/c 26, back 3/10.

2.5. DMUGM Workshop!

3. Certificates / Signing
- AW Mantid have signing certificate, we could use the same.
- DN SSG should take ownership of certificate and allow use for all.
- Dissolve should consider using that too.
- OSX need further consideration.

4. TOML
- AW recent changes to ProcedureNode (based on 0.9.X) needed to be incorporated, but cherry-picking proc-edit-3 PR solves most of that issue.
- This puts the TOML branch on good footing.
- TY What's left?
- AW Once configurations finished, only thing left is ProcessingLayers, biggest one. However, while nodes/generators are OK and will take from the Configuration work, keywords still need to be done
- Needs to wait for AW return.

5. ProcedureNode
- Now 7 PRs.
- Qt Model now works.
- Turn SequenceProcedureNdoe into not a node.
- Tidy up, sort out
