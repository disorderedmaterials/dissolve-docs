1. Sprint Review, weeks 47-48
2. Sprint Planning, weeks 49-50
3. AOB

## 1. Sprint Review, weeks 47-48
- Module reorganisation and tidying complete (#877, #879, #880), followed by module data handling work (#890).
- ProcedureNode moved successfully off `List` (#876).
- Many small bugfixes.
- Keyword modernisation is complete (#865).

## 2. Sprint 49-50
- AW working on removing / disallowing spaces in names and had made progress, but noted that any effort put into this would be effectively superseded when the format of the input file is changed to something more standard / hierarchical in v1.0.
- TY agreed that this was probably not the best use of time for the final week's work of 2021, and we should focus instead on editability of `Procedure`s in the GUI.
- AW had already highlighted this as his next focus of work.
- TY to continue to proactively bugfixe as user-science problems are dealt with, and to move on to tagged issues on the list for 0.9.0 when appropriate.

## 3. AOB
- Owing to A/L, this will be the last TSC until January 2022.
