## 1. Project Direction, February 24

- JS has almost finished refactoring all analysis modules into the new framework, and several follow-on issues have been captured (e.g. parallelisation).
- AW investigations into GPU-ready data organisation in our core classes continues, but has already highlighted and removed one bottleneck in the code related to combinations.
- TY almost completely rewrote the CIF handling backend and refactored the GUI into a single window, and will move on to improving flexibility with which seed van der Waals potentials are applied to simulations.
- Investigations into the updating of CI e.g. to utilise git-cliff and enforce PR titles and milestoning are ongoing.

## 2. AOB

- Next TSC scheduled for Friday 22nd March, 14:00.
