## 1. Project Direction, December 23

- Release Planning: Version 1.4 was released on 12th January 2024 after being slightly delayed due to a critical bug being found in the Add Forcefield Wizard.

## 2. Version 1.5

Discussion of major work for inclusion into version 1.5:
- Move all analysis modules off of the old framework into the "developer-friendly" system illustrated by the refactored Q-Species module (#1747). (TY)
- Multi-configuration EPSR (DB).
- AW:

## 3. Strict Milestoning of PRs

In order to make generation of release notes less of a headache it is suggested that each PR must be associated to a milestone. The CI will reject immediately any PR which is not associated to a milestone.

## 4. AOB

- TY suggested that, due the increasing variance in people's calendars it is prudent to schedule TSCs only one month in advance, with the date of the next meeting to be discussed at the end of the forerunner TSC.
