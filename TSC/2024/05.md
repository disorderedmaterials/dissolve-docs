## 1. Project Direction, May 24

- TY generated a stack of PRs refactoring the `PairPotential` class with a view to implementing artificial atoms (#1900) as a next step.
- TY, RB, and AW started on a full, ground-up redesign of the GUI in QML, working from a custom theme as the base. Significant effort is being put into assessing how the 2D/3D graphing and visualisation is to be tackled, since integration of the existing "plot" code (based on Qt3D) ran into several blockers.
- AW and RB put significant effort into illustrating threaded parallelisation of a core analysis routine (SiteRDF) but ran into several as-yet-unsolved issues which meant that the expected improvements in efficiency could not be realised.
- DB and TY implemented Buckingham and Gaussian-form interaction potentials.

## 2. QML & Visualisation

## 3. AOB

- Next TSC scheduled for Friday 31st May 2024.
